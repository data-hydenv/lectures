# Palying with Indices

There is data of three student generations in the database. Which one was the warmest? Which one the coldest year in average?
```{sql connection=con}

```

How do these temperatures look like if you exclude 30% of the brightest measurements as they might be considered as highly influenced by radiation.
```{sql connection=con}

```

And additionally the 10% of warmest measurements?
```{sql connection=con}

```

Calculate the minimum temperature for each day, when the light sensor wasn't recording any radiation across all HOBO sensors of 2019
```{sql connection=con}

```

Order the last result by ascending temperatures and subset only the coldest 40%. What is their average minimum daily-dark temperature?
```{sql connection=con}

```


What did the same index look like for 2017 and 2018, complete the task in one query.
```{sql connection=con}

```

Take again the coldest 40% of the daily minimum temperatures of these generation recordings, while it was dark. How many percent were observed in 2018, how many in 2019? 
```{sql connection=con}

```



# cleanup
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
