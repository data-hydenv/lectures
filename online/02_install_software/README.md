# Install Software

To work properly on the PostgreSQL database, we need to install some additional
software packages. You will need [QGis](https://qgis.org) for quickly visualizing
spatial data and creating maps. [PgAdmin4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a
handy tool for maintaining a PostgreSQL database. Optionally, you can install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to manage virtual
Python and R environments, which you might have installed anyway.
Finally, to follow this lecture you can install [hydenv](https://pypi.org/project/hydenv/), a tool I wrote to dramatically decrease the preparation workload
for this lecture.
