# Other RDBMS

There are also other (R)DBMS available.

## MySQL / MariaDB

* Most commonly used on web-servers

* From a practical point of view, the same system

* since 2008 MySQL is **not** open source anymore. MariaDB is the open source
alternative to MySQL

## SQLite

* file-bound system, that does not require a server

* common data exchange format

* drivers exist for every OS and any programming language

## SQL Server

* commercial system by Microsoft

* very widely spreaded

* targets (medium and) large businesses

## oracle

* most frequently used RDBMS

* has a Java compiler integrated (which is nice for Java applications)

## Google Firebase

* cloud based non-relational document database

* **extremely** scalable and fast

* no setup, installation, initialization, table creation or data modeling needed.
Just connect and save data. (Thus rapid development possible)

## AWS DynamoDB

* pretty much like Google Firebase (not in a technical sense)

* 25 GB free quota (that's really, really a lot)

* a bit of initialization is necessary (compared to Firebase)

## MongoDB

* flagship of open-source non-relational document databases

* easily scalable, but you have to do it on your own

* powerful query language
