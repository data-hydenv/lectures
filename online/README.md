# Online Lecture

The data management lecture will be an online event this year. Most of the
lecture will be composed of short videos along with something to read and
exercises.

This year, you will need to install the database system locally on your
computer. We need this as a backup for solving exercises in case the remote
database is causing problems. This can happen, as we don't see each other in
person and communication is a bit more complicated. Thus, group works and
group discussion, eg. to decide upon data structures in the database, might not
work out very well. The local installation is a fallback.

To ease the work with the database, a command line tool is provided that will
support you with all necessary steps. The tool is written in Python
(CLI dev and database design is something that R or Matlab is not suitable for...).
If you have Python 3 on your system, you can directly install the tool, otherwise
you either have to install Python or use one of the executables on Github, if
your OS is supported.
