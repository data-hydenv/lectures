# Install Postges

PostgreSQL is a **R**lational **D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystem, or
short **RDBMS**. That means, it's a bundle of different software applications
of which the actual database is just one. Thus, installing PostgreSQL works
different on different systems (Linux, Mac, Windows), requires some elevated
permissions on the operating system and entail maintenace work.

Thus, we will introudce the local installation, as well as a cloud based
provisioning of a hosted PostgreSQL instance. For following the lectures, we
recommend installing a local instance directly on your OS  or to run a Linux
virtual machine (use e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
and follow all instructions for Linux.
